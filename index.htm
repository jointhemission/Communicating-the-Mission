        Project overview based on my most recent abstract.

        <strong>Personality and Language Usage. Personality-Specific Manifestations in Linguistic Structures.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        Although the intertwining of the traditions of psychology and linguistics has yet to reach the desired level of interdisciplinarity, the question legitimately arises as to what tangible, mathematical–statistical patterns human cognition leaves behind in human language use. This research focuses on issues such as the statistical modeling of linguistic fingerprints, the quantification of language use, and the statistically verifiable personality correlates of these phenomena, all underpinned by an extraordinarily complex neural background.
    </p>

    <p>
        What happens when, armed with Python and computational linguistics tools, one searches for coherence and discrepancy patterns in 10,000 blog posts produced by 55 individual language users, and embeds the results of 16 linguistic-statistical indicators into a contemporary personality-theoretical framework? What is the significance of the fact that, in human language use, patterns appear to emerge that go beyond mere randomness?
    </p>

    <p>
        What legal and ethical barriers currently hinder corpus construction and corpus-linguistic methodologies that, in light of empirical findings, could significantly advance our understanding of human cognitive functioning—while legislators remain unprepared for the challenges posed by generative AI and big data in the 21st century? At present, there is no up-to-date legal framework for the novel tools required for the potentially fruitful syntheses of the AI turn across scientific disciplines. This is especially true for diagnostically valuable exploratory research, where interdisciplinary cooperation is legally indispensable even at the level of data collection.
    </p>

    <p>
        The results of classical linguistic-statistical indicators strongly support the potential inherent in applications of Natural Language Processing & Understanding, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models. A deeper understanding and quantification of linguistic manifestations in the age of AI promises nothing less than a revolution in modeling 20th-century personality theories and their neural correlates. The ultimate vision is the modeling of personality change through idiolectal language variation.
